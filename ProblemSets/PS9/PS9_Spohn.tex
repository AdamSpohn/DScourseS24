\section{Introduction}

After coding the "recipe" the dimensions of housing\_training is 404 observations over 14 variables. This is the same number of variables as the original housing data. However, the housing\_train\_x has 74 variables. 
\section{LASSO}
The optimal lambda is 0.005689866.
The in sample rmse is 1.964934.
The out of sampple rmse is 0.170

\section{Ridge Regression}
The optimal lambda is 0.03727594.
The in sample rmse is 1.959118
The out of sample rmse is  0.1733747


\section{Other questions}
If there are more columns than rows, than you could still be able to make a linear regression if you employed some methods,like dimension reduction using PCA for example. 
LASSO has a higher bias, but lower variance when compared to Ridge Regression. This hints that it lends more towards being a simpler model or underfit. 
The Ridge Regression model has lower bias but higher variance when compared to LASSO, hinting that it might be more complex, and overfit compared to LASSO.
