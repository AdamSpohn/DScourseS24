\section{Introduction}

In step 5, the estimate using a closed form solution is very close to what our true values for beta are. 
In step 7, the L-BFGS method and Nelder Mead method results did differ, and the L-BFGS mehtod was much more accurate to the true values.
The easy method in step 9 is also very close and accurate to the true values. For example X5 is 3.5006 compared to the true value of 3.5.
