\section{Introduction}
I had an issue where trying to print the final table it would not all fit on the page, so I split it up into four tables for visibility. Additionally, as discussed through email I had trouble with the SVM model. I ended up letting it run for 6 hours before I stopped it, so I beleive the error I had must have been causing something to go wrong. So that model is not included here.

\section{Logit Table}


\input{logit_ans.tex}

\section{Tree Table}
\input{best_tree.tex}
\section{nnet Table}
\input{best_nnet.tex}
\section{knn Table}
\input{best_knn.tex}

\section{out of sample accuracy}
The following is the accuracy for each model
- logit .8526
- tree .8684
- nnet .8326
- knn .8433

Based on this it seems like Tree and Logit were the most accurate
